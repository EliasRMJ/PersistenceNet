# PersistenceNet
The `PersistenceNet` package is intended to make it easier to implement your project's `persistence context`. It provides some features following current development patterns. Below, some of these features will be described for a better understanding.

> NOTE: Create a local database and run a migration to create the table used in `ContextTest` before starting the application.
